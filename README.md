The Emergence of The Trac Network: Its First Application, ‘HyperMall’
Introduction

The launch of the HyperMall App marks a significant milestone in the development of the Trac Network, and will demonstrate its advanced capabilities as a fully-functional Layer 1 network.


While the Trac Network already performs Bitcoin indexing and oracle services as two of its core functionalities, these are only small components of its broader framework.

The Trac Network is its own decentralized, Layer 1 network that is designed to surpass all existing blockchain models in terms of speed, cost, efficiency, and scalability.

This is all possible because unlike traditional blockchains, the Trac Network is not a chain and therefore has no blocks or sequential processing, so it does not suffer from bottlenecks as the network scales.

Instead, the Trac Network represents a novel architecture that redefines the capabilities of decentralized ledger networks.

Key Features of HyperMall

Trac Wallet: The app provides users with their first opportunity to create their own Trac Wallet.
Network Node: Every instance of the HyperMall app acts as a node, which contributes toward network operations and efficiency.
Decentralized Trading: HyperMall serves as a fast and cost-efficient platform for trading digital assets.
AI Integration: Future iterations will leverage decentralized AI agents for enhanced functionality.
HyperMall Participants

HyperMall is designed for two categories of participants:

Validators — Those who validate network transactions and earn rewards.
Users — Individual traders on the platform.
HyperMall: The First Application on the Trac Network

HyperMall is a high-speed trading platform built on the Trac Network. It incorporates social chat features and AI-driven components, providing an innovative marketplace experience, with the capability to delegate trading responsibilities to an AI Agent for maximised trading efficiency. (AI Agents not available in this initial V1 release of the app).

Once the HyperMall app is installed (Windows/Mac/Linux) it becomes a fully self-contained, decentralized, and user-owned Trac App!

This is in stark contrast to the centralised, web2 app model that we’ve seen historically from entities like the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, for example.

AI Integration within HyperMall

The Trac Network enables decentralized AI, and in order for AI agents to function in a fully decentralized manner, they must run locally on users’ devices, so they remain independent of any centralized infrastructure.

This approach differentiates HyperMall from conventional AI-driven platforms, which typically rely on centralized cloud computing.

So in later releases of the HyperMall, AI Agents will be able to trade for users.

‘Trac Keys’

All Trac Network validators will receive personal Trac Keys. Keys unlock all earning opportunities on the network.

Anyone who has already purchased (or purchases in future sales) a Trac Validator Licence will automatically gain access to a Trac Key so can begin earning on the Trac Network with HyperMall.

In the future (Q2 2025), Trac Keys will become fully-owned, tradable digital assets via a claim/mint event. However for the HyperMall launch, keys will be accessed via a temporary wallet-pairing process.

Validators will ‘pair’ their new Trac Wallet with the Bitcoin wallet they used to purchase their validator licence(s). By signing a transaction to confirm the pairing, they will gain instant access to their keys for the HyperMall.

One Trac Key. Unlimited Earning Opportunities.

Although a validator’s Trac Key will be created within the HyperMall app, this will be their master-key for all future earning opportunities across the entire Trac Network.

The Trac Network is a multi-subsidy network, so any app can incentivise validators to support its efficient operation by offering them their own token rewards.

For example, if Netflix decided to run their decentralised streaming app on the Trac Network, they could ensure it remains highly performant by rewarding validators with their own token. After all, why would a validator support an app that isn’t paying them?

The Next Earning Opportunity

HyperMall is the first opportunity to validate on the Trac Network, and in Q2 2025, the opportunity to also validate indexing data for the TAP Protocol will go live! Validator’s keys will automatically make them eligible to begin earning $TAP rewards for validating TAP data.

Additionally, after the $TRAC token (original BRC-20 version) is integrated into the Trac Network (Q2 2025) and becomes the native gas token for the entire network ($TRAC token 2.0), a validator’s Trac Key will also enable them to unlock fee rewards (in $TRAC) for validating the operation of the full Network.

‘Trac IDs’

Regardless of whether someone is a validator or a user, the wallet they generate within the HyperMall app automatically acts as their Trac ID.

Trac IDs function as a unique identifier within the Trac Network, and the Trac ID system operates without requiring KYC verification, preserving the principles of decentralized online identities.

Every validator and user of the HyperMall will receive their own wallet, and therefore, their own Trac ID.

Asset Trading on HyperMall

Initially, HyperMall will facilitate lightning-speed trading of purely Bitcoin-based assets. However, given TAP Protocol’s ongoing cross-chain expansion strategy, additional assets from other Layer 1 ecosystems will also be introduced over time.

For example, TAP Protocol already has bridges with Ethereum and TRON, and these are the first of many, as TAP will continue further cementing itself as the L1 Bitcoin hub for multi-chain assets.

TAP has always built towards attracting greater liquidity to Bitcoin, not fracturing it, as is seen with the majority of the scaling solutions coming to market.

TAP’s multi-chain asset strategy will enable an increasing range of assets to access any App that is built on the Trac Network. This makes the Trac Network a compelling choice for any builders who want to acquire users and liquidity from all major chains.

Ultimately…..Trac helps TAP, and TAP helps Trac!

Initial Trading Pairs

The first release of HyperMall (V1) will support the trading of:

$TAP (token of TAP Protocol)
$GIB
Users will need to hold these assets in order to trade on this initial release of Hypermall.

Summary

HyperMall serves as the first live demonstration of the Trac Network as a fully decentralized, and highly performant Layer 1 network.

Through its scalable infrastructure, decentralized validation model, and AI integration, the broader potential of the Trac Network will be demonstrated with HyperMall.

The Trac Network introduces a new paradigm in decentralized computing, distinct from traditional blockchain structures. As additional applications emerge on the network, its advantages in speed, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness will become increasingly evident.

Receive Further Updates

Further Trac Network updates and announcement about the HyperMall will be communicated via both Trac and TAP socials, in addition to the monthly newsletter and blog.
